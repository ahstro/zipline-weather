#[Zipline: Show the Local Weather](http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/zipline-show-the-local-weather)

This is my take on one of [freeCodeCamp](http://www.freecodecamp.com/)'s Ziplines, specifically the one mentioned in the huge headline above.
It's written using [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/), CSS3 and JavaScript ES6, so you'll probalby need to compile some stuff to get it to work locally.

A not necessarily up to date version can be found on [CodePen](http://codepen.io/ahstro/full/YXmXxw/).
